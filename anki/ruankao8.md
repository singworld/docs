Regardless of how well designed, constructed, and tested a system or application may be, errors or bugs will inevitably occur. Once a system has been （此空作答）, it enters operations and support.Systems support is the ongoing technical support for user, as well as the maintenance required to fix any errors, omissions,or new requirements that may arise. 

Before an information system can be （   ）, it must be in operation. System operation is the day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, and year-t-year（ ）of an information system's business processes and application programs.Unlike systems analysis, design, and implementation, systems support cannot sensibly be（ ） into actual phases that a support project must perform. Rather, systems support consists of four ongoing activities that are program maintenance, system recovery, technical support, and system enhancement. Each activity is a type of support project that is（ ） by a particular problem, event, or opportunity encountered with the implemented system.


无论一个系统或应用程序的设计、构造和测试有多好，错误或漏洞都会不可避免地发生。系统支持是对用户的持续技术支持，以及修复任何错误、遗漏或可能出现的新要求所需的维护。

在一个信息系统能够被（ ）之前，它必须处于运行状态。系统运行是指信息系统的业务流程和应用程序的日复一日、周复一周、月复一月、年复一年（ ）的运行。与系统分析、设计和实施不同，系统支持不能合理地分为支持项目必须执行的实际阶段。相反，系统支持包括四个持续的活动，即程序维护、系统恢复、技术支持和系统增强。每项活动都是支持项目的一种类型，是（ ）。每项活动都是一种支持项目，是由已实施的系统遇到的特定问题、事件或机会引起的。
